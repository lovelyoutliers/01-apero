  Exploring mental illness through systems thinking (MIST).

<!-- this is a subheadline -->
MIST is my current research programme, funded by the NIHR Advanced Fellowship (2022-27). This research aims to identify the social and environmental causes of severe mental illness, self-harm, and suicide. My research has a particular focus on socially excluded populations, including migrants, minority ethnic groups, and those who face material, social, political, or structural exclusion.

My research aims to explore the drivers of mental illnesses within the social environment, using tools from epidemiology, systems science, and data science

My long-term goal is to further our understanding of the causal architecture underlying severe mental illnesses and inform policies and population-based interventions which could prevent the onset and reduce the burden of mental health problems in socially excluded groups.
