  Exploring mental illness through systems thinking (MIST).

<!-- this is a subheadline -->
My research aims to identify the social and environmental causes of severe mental illness, self-harm, and suicide. My research has a particular focus on socially excluded populations, including migrants, minority ethnic groups, and those who face material, social, political, or structural exclusion.

In order to tackle these research questions, I use tools from epidemiology, data science, systems thinking, and public mental health.

My long-term goal is to further our understanding of the causal architecture underlying severe mental illnesses and inform policies and population-based interventions which could prevent the onset and reduce the burden of mental health problems in socially excluded groups.

## Research interests
+ Social and spatial determinants of mental illnesses, including psychosis, bipolar disorder, and suicide
+ Public mental health  
+ Epidemiological research methods, particularly longitudinal analysis of big data
+ Systems modelling and simulation
