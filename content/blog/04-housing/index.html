<h2>Building websites and my R skills</h2>
<p>One of the great things about academica is that you never stop learning, which is also one of the difficult things, as you are always a beginner and constantly feeling out of your depth.</p>
<p>[constantly learning gif if can figure out how to do that…]</p>
<p>This site is something that has been on the back-burner for ages. I wanted to have a space where I could share research outputs, connect with other researchers, and experiment with different approaches to science communication, but it was never a “priority.”</p>
<p>But as I start a new chapter of my research journey, I have committed to becoming more competent in R, so figured I could work on my R coding skills AND build an academic website at the same time.</p>
<p>I am tremendously grateful to <a href="https://www.apreshill.com/">Alison Hill</a> for her amazing tutorials and this gorg template.</p>
