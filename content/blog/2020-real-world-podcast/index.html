<p>One of the exciting new projects I have been involved in is the launch of a new podcast: Real World Public Mental Health. This podcast was developed as a forum to discuss how evidence can be used in the real world to prevent mental health problems and promote better mental health.</p>

<p>It is hosted by Stu King of the Behavioural Science and Public Health Network in partnership with a bunch of collaborators, including our NIHR Public Mental Health Programme and Public Health England.</p>
<p>I was delighted to participate in the second episode, which has just been released <a href="https://www.buzzsprout.com/1427881/6798052-social-isolation-loneliness-financial-strain-dr-jen-dykxhoorn-ed-davie-caron-walker">Social isolation, loneliness, and financial strain</a>.</p>
<p>In this episode, I join Ed Davie and Caron Walker to discuss the impact of loneliness, social isolation, and financial strain on mental health problems, with consideration to the influence of COVID-19 and the start of the holiday season.
