### Background

According to the [UN Human High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR)](https://www.unhcr.org/refugee-statistics/), 


### What did we do?

We used data from the Swedish population registers, which includes all individuals living in Sweden, and collect information on age, sex, migration status, education, income, and health care. We included 1.3 million people born between 1984 and 1997.

*Exposures:* Refugee status & region We classified all participants by refugee status:

+  refugee migrants, or

+  non-refugee migrants

*Confounders:* We adjusted for age and sex. We also considered income as a possible confounder in a sensitivity analysis.

*Analysis:* We calculated incidence rates for each population group, and used survival analysis to estimate unadjusted and adjusted hazard ratios.


### What did we find?

The rate of affective psychotic disorder was 2.07 times higher in refugees compared to the Swedish-born population. The rate was 1.4 times higher in non-refugee migrants compared to the Swedish-born group.


### What does this mean?

> We found that the rate of affective psychotic disorders was nearly twice as high in refugees compared to the native-born population, and further that there was nearly a 50% increase in rates when refugees were compared to non-refugee migrants.
>
> We also found that refugees and non-refugee migrants had consistently lower rates of non-psychotic bipolar disorders.


In general, studies like this which highlight population groups most vulnerable to mental health problems can be essential to planning public health interventions and mental health care to ensure the most vulnerable groups have access to support. Additionally, research which reveals differences in patterns of diseases hints at possible mechanisms underlying these differences, which can further our understanding of the fundamental causes of mental health problems.
