<h3>Background</h3>
<p>Improving public mental health, promoting well-being, and preventing mental illness is a major priority for public health in the UK. Importantly, communities can play an important role in providing public mental health interventions which target key determinants of mental health.</p>

<h3>Why did we do this research?</h3>
<p>Mapping available community-based mental health interventions can show us what is currently available across England, what do these interventions look like, and see if available services align with mental health needs.</p>
<p>This research was part of the <a href="https://sphr.nihr.ac.uk/category/research/public-mental-health/">NIHR School for Public Health Researchâ€™s Public Mental Health Programme</a> research programme. This work was lead by Dr Fiona Duncan (Durham University) and Michael McGrath (UCL), with support from across the Public Mental Health Programme.</p>

<h3>What did we do?</h3>
<p>Normally I would jump into a brief summary of what we did, what we found, and why it matters, but the <a href="https://www.nationalelfservice.net/mental-health/">Mental Elf</a> published a terrific summary of this work on their blog today, including an overview of the research, the limitations, and next steps.</p>
