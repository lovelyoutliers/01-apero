### Background 
The Briefing Room is a programme where David Aaronovitch invites experts to explore the big issues in the news. In a special 4 part series on health, Aaronovitch looked to explore the recent increase in mental health problems like anxiety and depression. 

I was invited to participate in the expert panel, alongside Prof Jennifer Wild, Dr Sharon Neufeld, and Prof Thalia Ele to discuss the research and what they mean. 

It was a fantastic conversation, and a true pleasure to get a chance to go to the BBC Broadcasting House to record.
