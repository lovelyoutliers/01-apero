<h3>Background</h3>
<p>The Briefing Room is a programme where David Aaronovitch invites experts to explore the big issues in the news. In a special 4 part series on health, Aaronovitch looked to explore the recent increase in mental health problems like anxiety and depression.</p>
<p>I was invited to participate in the expert panel, alongside Prof Jennifer Wild, Dr Sharon Neufeld, and Prof Thalia Ele to discuss the research and what they mean.</p>
<p>It was a fantastic conversation, and a true pleasure to get a chance to go to the BBC Broadcasting House to record.</p>
