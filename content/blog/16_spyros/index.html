<p>Using Swedish register data, Spyros found deprivation at birth &amp; upbringing was associated with later age-at-first-diagnosis of psychotic disorder, after adjustment for confounders 2/n

A one standard deviation increase in deprivation at birth resulted in a 47 day delay (95%CI: 18-77) in first diagnosis 3/n

Interestingly, this pattern was initially masked by family income levels (with lower income associated with earlier diagnosis). Once adjusted for income, delays in diagnosis in more deprived neighbourhoods became evident 4/n

We found no evidence this differed by sex or non-affective vs. affective diagnosis, and no evidence of an association with population density; patterns were similar when exposure during upbringing was used 5/n

There may be barriers to accessing timely care for psychosis amongst those born and growing up in more deprived communities, providing an opportunity for tailored, targeted #earlyintervention #eip 6/n

<h2>Why did we do this research?</h2>
<p>The relationship between neighborhood-level factors and the incidence of psychotic disorders is well established. However, it is unclear whether neighborhood characteristics are also associated with age-at-first-diagnosis of these disorders.</p>
</div>
<div id="what-did-we-do" class="section level2">
<h2>What did we do?</h2>
<p>We used linked Swedish register data to identify a cohort of persons first diagnosed with an ICD-10 non-affective or affective psychotic disorder (F20-33) between 1997 and 2016. Using multilevel mixed-effect linear modelling, we investigated whether neighborhood deprivation and population density at birth were associated with age-at-first diagnosis of a psychotic disorder. Our final cohort included 13,440 individuals, with a median age-at-first-diagnosis of 21.8 years for women (interquartile range [IQR]: 19.0-25.5) and 22.9 years for men (IQR: 20.1-26.1; p&lt;.0001).</p>
</div>
<div id="what-did-we-find" class="section level2">
<h2>What did we find?</h2>
<p>n an unadjusted model, we found no evidence of an association between neighborhood deprivation and age-at-first-diagnosis of psychotic disorder (p=.07). However, after multivariable adjustment, age-at-first-diagnosis increased by .13 years (95% CI: .05 to .21; p=.002) for a one standard deviation increase in neighborhood deprivation. This was equivalent to a later diagnosis of 47 days (95% CI: 18 to 77). We found no evidence of a different relationship for non-affective versus affective psychoses (LRT χ2(1) = .14; p=.71). Population density was not associated with age-at-first-diagnosis in unadjusted (p=.81) or adjusted (p=.85) models. Later age-at-first-diagnosis for individuals born in more deprived neighborhoods suggests structural barriers to accessing equitable psychiatric care.</p>
