<h2>Why did we do this research?</h2>
<p>The relationship between neighborhood-level factors and the incidence of psychotic disorders is well established. However, it is unclear whether neighborhood characteristics are also associated with age-at-first-diagnosis of these disorders.</p>
</div>
<div id="what-did-we-do" class="section level2">
<h2>What did we do?</h2>
<p>We used linked Swedish register data to identify a cohort of persons first diagnosed with an ICD-10 non-affective or affective psychotic disorder (F20-33) between 1997 and 2016.</p>
<p>Using multilevel mixed-effect linear modelling, we investigated whether neighborhood deprivation and population density at birth were associated with age-at-first diagnosis of a psychotic disorder.
Our final cohort included 13,440 individuals, with a median age-at-first-diagnosis of 21.8 years for women (interquartile range [IQR]: 19.0-25.5) and 22.9 years for men (IQR: 20.1-26.1; p&lt;.0001).</p>
</div>
<div id="what-did-we-find" class="section level2">
<h2>What did we find?</h2>
<p>A one standard deviation increase in deprivation at birth resulted in a 47 day delay (95% CI: 18-77) in first diagnosis.</p>
<p>Interestingly, this association was first maksed by family income (in the unadjusted models), but once we accounted for income, delays in diagonsis related to neighbourhood deprivation became apparent (adjusted models).</p>
<p>We found no evidence this differed by sex or non-affective vs.Â affective diagnosis, and no evidence of an association with population density; patterns were similar when exposure during upbringing was used.</p>
</div>
<div id="what-does-this-mean" class="section level2">
<h2>What does this mean?</h2>
<p>Later age-at-first-diagnosis for individuals born in more deprived neighborhoods suggests structural barriers to accessing equitable psychiatric care.</p>
<p>There may be barriers to accessing timely care for psychosis amongst those born and growing up in more deprived communities, providing an opportunity for tailored, targeted early intervention.</p>
