## Why did we do this research?
There is compelling evidence that the risk of developing mental health problems depend on social and structural factors. These factors, also called the 'social determinants of mental health' include  a wide range of factors including income, housing, childhood adversity, and neighbourhood conditions. 

Critically, these factors are not randomly distributed. Some individuals and groups are much more likely to experience these social risk factors, and a far higher burden of mental health problems. 

The point of this review was to summarise the state of the evidence around the social determinants of mental health, highlight 'what works'  to prevent mental health problems, and urges us to shift our focus to viewing mental health inequalities as a issue of social justice requiring urgent action. 

## Prevention strategies to address the social determinants of mental health 
We highlighted a range of prevention strategies which aim to prevent mental health problems and support those experiencing mental health problems.

## Key recommendations
1. Make social justice central to all public mental health interventions.
Mental health problems are inequitably distributed between and within
populations, principally arising from systemic structural inequalities.
Making social justice core to all public mental health interventions and
policies would reduce these inequities.
2. Invest in interventions that pay off in multiple domains. Few social
determinants solely affect mental health. Investing in interventions that
target key social determinants will improve physical, mental and social
outcomes for individuals and communities. Intervention programs
should routinely measure mental health alongside these other outcomes.
3. Invest in interventions that target critical windows of the life
course to interrupt intergenerational transmission of mental health
inequalities. Providing good-quality and accessible parental and familial
support early in life can interrupt the intergenerational transmission of
mental health inequalities within families or communities.
4. Prioritize interventions that focus on poverty alleviation. Any
comprehensive public health approach to reduce the burden of poor
mental health must include efforts to reduce poverty. Poverty is
inextricably linked to most social determinants of mental health, and
could be considered a root cause.
5. Strengthen causal inference in research on social determinants
of mental health and primary prevention. Most research on social
determinants of mental health is observational, often subject to selection
and confounding bias. Stronger causal inference methods are needed, as
well as larger, interdisciplinary observational and experimental studies
in representative and adequately powered samples to accelerate progress
of knowledge and develop effective primary interventions.
6. Establish inclusive longitudinal population mental health monitoring.
Many countries struggle to accurately estimate psychiatric morbidity
in their populations, which inhibits both clinical and public mental
health provision. Samples are often unrepresentative. Reliable, inclusive
and precise longitudinal monitoring of population mental health is the
essential basis for effective prevention.
7. Ensure parity between primary, secondary and tertiary prevention in
mental health. Investing sufficiently in primary prevention to stop the
onset of mental disorders prevents suffering, improves quality of life
and societal outcomes, and reduces demand for secondary and tertiary
prevention.

To read a summary of this research, one of my PhD students [Alua Yeskendir]() wrote a fantastic piece summarising the main findings: [Poor mental health is not random](https://blogs.ucl.ac.uk/mental-health/2024/01/12/poor-mental-health-is-not-random-what-can-we-do-to-achieve-social-justice/). She also created the beautiful illustrations featured in this post.
