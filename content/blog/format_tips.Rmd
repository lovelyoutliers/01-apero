## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

Ctrl + Alt + I (Cmd + Option + I on macOS).

```{r}

```

## Headers and bullet points

# Header 1 level

## Header 2 level

### Header 3 level

How to turn just one word **bold** or *italics* was another thing I was hoping to figure out

And adjusting the spacing within paragraphs is something that seems to be fine in the first paragraph in my posts but the rest of the text gets really crowded. Work on this as well. I think I will just keep writing for a little bit and see what I need to do to adjust the spacing. This might not be a point and click sort of problem I can fix.

-   I have been struggling with making my points

-   so using visual editor

-   this seems easy!

# Numbering 

1.  I would also like to be able to number things better

2.  This also seems quite fine

## Figures

Useful to use an R chunk for figures as I can adjust figure width, height, alignment, caption

fig.width and fig.height: The (graphical device) size of R plots in inches. R plots in code chunks are first recorded via a graphical device in knitr, and then written out to files. You can also specify the two options together in a single chunk option fig.dim, e.g., fig.dim = c(6, 4) means fig.width = 6 and fig.height = 4.

out.width and out.height: The output size of R plots in the output document. These options may scale images. You can use percentages, e.g., out.width = '80%' means 80% of the page width.

fig.align: The alignment of plots. It can be 'left', 'center', or 'right'.

dev: The graphical device to record R plots. Typically it is 'pdf' for LaTeX output, and 'png' for HTML output, but you can certainly use other devices, such as 'svg' or 'jpeg'.

fig.cap: The figure caption.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="75%", fig.align = 'center', fig.cap=""}
knitr::include_graphics("featured.jpg")
```

Side-by-side figures

fig.show='hold'

out.width 50%

Have tried to use these when the graphics weren't working - so option if trouble shooting.If you want to include a graphic that is not generated from R code, you may use the knitr::include_graphics() function, which gives you more control over the attributes of the image than the Markdown syntax of ![alt text or image title](path/to/image) (e.g., you can specify the image width via out.width). Figure 2.6 provides an example of this.

```{r, out.width='25%', fig.align='center', fig.cap='...'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/hex-rmarkdown.png')
```
