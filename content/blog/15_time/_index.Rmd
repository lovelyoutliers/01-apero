Despite the intimidating level of work required to get reach this hallowed status, PhD students can be surprisingly resourceful when it comes to wasting time.

As an epidemiologist, my research is all about running statistics on a computer. I have access to super large datasets, and attempt to run code. These massive datasets require a lot of computational power, so even when things are going well, I spend a lot of time watching the tiny white dot zoom around the blue windows waiting circle, jiggling the mouse on occasion so my computer doesn't go to sleep. (When things aren't going well, I don't see the blue waiting signal either because my eyes are misty with the silent weeping or because the screen is filled with the most devastating amount of red error messages possible.
