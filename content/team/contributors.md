Research is not a solitary act. All of the work described in this site has only been possible due to extraordinary mentors, collaborators, students, and trainees. In some ways this is my psyc epi genealogy! 

### Mentors and supervisors
+ [Prof Kate Walters](https://iris.ucl.ac.uk/iris/browse/profile?upi=KWALT44) and [Prof David Osborn](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/psychiatry/people/david-osborn) were the principal investigators of the [NIHR Public Mental Health Programme](https://sphr.nihr.ac.uk/category/research/public-mental-health/). I was the programme manager and senior research fellow for this research during my postdoc (2019-22). David continues to be a mentor for my current fellowship. 

+ [Prof James Kirkbride](https://www.psylife.eu/): James was one of my PhD supervisors (2015-19) and is the head of the PsyLife group at UCL. The PsyLife group explores inequalities in the social determinants of psychosis and other mental health problems over the life course. 

+ [Prof Kerry Keyes](https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/profile/katherine-m-keyes-phd): I had the opportunity to work with Kerry and her research group during a 6-month research visit to Columbia University in 2023, learning advanced methods and working on suicide and opioid research projects. 

+ [Prof Glyn Lewis](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/brain-sciences/people/professor-glyn-lewis): Glyn also supervised my PhD and is a trailblazer in exploring the causes of psychiatric disorders, with a particular focus on depression and psychosis. 

+ [Prof Christina Dalman](https://staff.ki.se/people/christina-dalman): Christina is the research group leader for [Epidemiology of Psychiatric Conditions, Substance Use, and Social Environment](https://ki.se/en/gph/epidemiology-of-psychiatric-conditions-substance-use-and-social-environment-epicss-0?pk_vid=f8a2915634b84b3d16980493427df1a9) at Karolinska Institutet. I work closely with her for all projects using Swedish register data. 

+ [Prof Ian Colman](http://www.psychepi.com/): Ian was my MSc supervisor (2012-14), who guided me down the garden path of epi, big data, and longitudinal research. His research group is a leading psychiatric epidemiology group in Canada, producing rigorous research long-term processes surrounding common mental disorders and their treatment, including suicidal behaviour.

### Students and trainees
